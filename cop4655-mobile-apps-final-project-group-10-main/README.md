## Overview

### Description

This app will suggest parking areas on campus that are closest to users class. The app will  have the user select a drop-down building from the list and the app will find the nearest and the best parking spot for the user to park at

### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Navigation
- **Mobile:** We will work on maps and user location to best suit the apps users.
- **Story:** The value of the app is good, especially for new FAU students who have just first made it onto campus, or students who are new to an area in campus.
- **Market:** The market is niche as it caters specfically to FAU students, but this is an advantage as we can cater specfically to their needs.
- **Habit:** The user can use this app evetytime they come to school, until they are more used to the campus environment. 
- **Scope:** The app is well scoped and should be possible to develop within the given time frame. We have everything outlined and only need to implement and learn our optional goals.
