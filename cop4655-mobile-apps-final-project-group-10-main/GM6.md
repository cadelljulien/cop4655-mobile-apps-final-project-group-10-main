# App Ideas Brainstorming

## App Idea 1: College Parking App
### What: What is the app for?
This app will suggest parking areas on campus that are closest to users class

### Who: Who is the app for?
The app is for college (focus is FAU) students mostly commuters that don't know where the closest parking lot is

### Why: Why are we building this app?
We are building this app to provide users with an easy and simple tool to find parking near campus buildings 

### Challenges: What are some potential challenges?
A potential challenge is getting data from FAU or other colleges if scaled that could change each semester depending on where classes are located


## App Idea 2: DYEL - Do you even lift
### What: What is the app for?
Follows a tinder-like structure but for fellow gym bros that need to find a workout partner.
### Who: Who is the app for?
Gymbros or anyone that goes to the gym and is looking for a gym partner.
### Why: Why are we building this app?
Issa cold world out here and nobody wants to workout alone. Also having a good partner can really make or break your progress in the gym.
### Challenges: What are some potential challenges?
Definitely making it for gym bros and not like another tinder-like app where people go for the purpose of finding potential partners we already have tinder for that. However, if you find the 'loml' on there who am I to stop you?

## App Idea 3: GMF - Give me Food
### What: What is the app for?
Sometime I don't know what to cook, so we can implement a app that will take in what we have in the fridge and spit out a recipe backed by an API of what we can make.
### Who: Who is the app for?
Lazy people, uncreative people, or people that are way too busy to search up recipes and wants something that they can just input what is in their fridge and they can get a recipe.
### Why: Why are we building this app?
Cause sometimes you just don't know what to cook/make :100: 
### Challenges: What are some potential challenges?
- Finding the correct API
- Having the app understands what the user is inputting in

## App Idea 4: Allfish

App is used to help users find good fishing spots. It uses a variety of data and source points. Utlizes user-submitted reports, and forecasting. So with that it uses current location and maps out region to find a spot.
### Who: Who is the app for?
This is app is for those who currently fish such as beginners and well experienced folks. It can also be used for those looking to start fishing and those looking for a new spot to fish.
### Why: Why are we building this app?
To help people catch more fish using info which can be accessed easily. Another one would be that we'd like to help others save time and effort and increase their chances of success for cathcing fish.
### Challenges: What are some potential challenges?
Challenges inlcude collecting and maintaing accurate data, developing a user-friendly interface, and markting if we were to scale.

## App Idea 5: Fitness tracker
### What: What is the app for?
Anyone who wants to see how many calories something is and to track health related stats like steps.
### Who: Who is the app for?
Anyone who wants to make their fitness more fun.
### Why: Why are we building this app?
Most current fitness trackers are boring and difficult to use. A more fun and interactive app using colors and achievements and incentives would be better.

### Challenges: What are some potential challenges
Api calls, layouts on different devices. Unknown api costs. Ios updates. Smooth animations. Finding the most efficient technology to implement the app.
